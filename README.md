# lkm_experiments
In this repository we store our LKM experiments with modifying the Linux Kernel Source at runtime.

Each directory in experiments is one experiment. It contains both the source files as well as the output files. The output files are taken from dmesg unless states otherwise.

TODO: rerun experiments, for example 002 output is wrong.
